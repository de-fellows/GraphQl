    "## Goals \n",
    "* Build a simple web application that sorts different genres of music using Rest API and Flask. \n",
    "* Set up our own pythonn API.\n",
    "* Work with HTTP methods and implement GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods to adjust the database as we want.\n",
    "* Set up our database model using SCLAlchemy.\n",
    "* Implement the above using graphQL.  \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "API stands for *Application Programming Interface*, A set of definitions and protocols for integrating web applications. In other words, it is a sutup that allows two softwares or applications to connect and communicate with each other. We know that every software differ form one another. When two softwares communicate, one software is going to deal with whatever in the backend which is the main server. The other software will make requests to the server to retrieve data in the frontend. Rest API stands for *Representational State Transfer*. As the name implies, this type of API helps transfer data over the internet. This API is used to allow users to only view specific things from the backend. Its time that we introduce graphQL. graphQL is a query programming language for APIs and runtime. It simply gives the client the privelage of to ask for exactly what they need and only wat the need, This makes it easier when deling with more complex databases that contain huge amounts of data. Thus, unlike using a standart qurey language like SQL, graphQL is used to quere data from any number of sources.Thankfully, both Rest APIs and graphQL serve under HTTP. Although it is cnsidered a programming language, it pairs nicely with python. Now that we know the difference between Rest API and graphQL, we will try to build an application to store information about music genres using Rest API and then we will try to implement it with graphQL. This example is inspired from Caleb Curry where you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbLc5a9jdXo&list=LL&index=3). \n",

It runs on localhost:5000. However, any other framework will do the job. We install the dependecies that we need. To do this, write the following in the terminal:"
