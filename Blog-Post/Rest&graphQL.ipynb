    "## Goals \n",
    "* Build a simple web application that sorts different genres of music using Rest API and Flask. \n",
    "    * Set up  basic Flask web-server\n",
    "    * Set up a database model using SCLAlchemy.\n",
    "    * Work with HTTP methods and implement GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods to adjust the database as we want.\n",
    "* Implement the above using graphQL.  \n",

    "#### __How the project relates to the Digital Engineering curriculum__\n",
    "In the scope of this project, we are going to focus on the fourth principle ```Playing out of town``` from *Making Learning Whole* [Education at Bat: Seven Principles for Educators](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators). David perkins focuses on the the ability for learners to take their skills into the next level. He encourages learners to develpe transferrable knowledge that can be used flexibly in other fields. For instance, \n",
    "1. Students already know how to use Flask to develop a web-server. \n",
    "2. Students have worked with a different type of SQL to manipulate databases.\n",
    "3. Students have a former knowledge of HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the mentioned previous knowledge, students are encouraged to discover how to use this knowledge to achieve a simillar output with a different approach. By the end of this article, students will have:\n",
    "1. An intoductory knowledge to a new language.\n",
    "2. Learn the basic syntax of the language.\n",
    "3. Learn how to query data from a database.\n",

    "## Brief introduction\n",
    "API stands for *Application Programming Interface*, A set of definitions and protocols for integrating web applications. In other words, it is a sutup that allows two softwares or applications to connect and communicate with each other. We know that every software differ form one another. When two softwares communicate, one software is going to deal with whatever in the backend which is the main server. The other software will make requests to the server to retrieve data in the frontend. Rest API stands for *Representational State Transfer*. As the name implies, this type of API helps transfer data over the internet. This is used to allow users to only view specific things from the backend. It is time that we introduce graphQL. graphQL is a query programming language for APIs and a server-side runtime. It simply gives the client the privelage of to ask for exactly what they need and only what the need, This makes it easier when dealing with more complex databases that contain huge amounts of data. Thus, unlike using a standart qurey language like SQL, graphQL is used to query data from any number of sources.Thankfully, both Rest APIs and graphQL pair with python nicely. In this project, we will try to build an application to store information about music genres using Rest API and then we will try to implement it with graphQL. This example is inspired from Caleb Curry where you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbLc5a9jdXo&list=LL&index=3). \n",

    "lets start by creating our oun Rest API with python. We will use Flask as our framework. Flask is highly recommended since it is a more simpler setup compared to other frameworks i.e. Django and Ruby. Flask runs on localhost:5000. However, any other framework will do the job. We are going to install the dependecies that we need to be able to work with the framework in our preferred environment. To do this, write the following in the terminal:"

    "We introduced the query language GraphQL, but the question is what makes GraphQL more special and how does it differ from rest API's? REST API's are modeled as resources. We provide endpoints to access particular data and define which HTTP methods are used at each endpoint. On the other hand, GraphQL models the API as a graph.The GraphQL Schema Definition Language allows for defining the types and fields on each type the data. The types defined in a GraphQL schema are treated as nodes. The cleint can then make queries at a certain endpoint to access data at that particular node of interest. For more information, ypu can look at [The official GraphQl Documentaion](https://graphql.org/learn/). So to make it more simple, the main reasons the new declaritive query language is better are :\n",
